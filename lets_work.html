I had many pets, and I felt happy when I fed and cared for them. When I grew up, I married a woman who also liked animals. Together we had birds, a dog, a rabbit, a monkey, and a big black cat called Pluto. Pluto was my favourite pet. He followed me everywhere, and I loved him. But things started to change. I began to drink too much alcohol, and little by little I became angry, rude, and violent. I shouted at my wife and hurt my other animals. Only Pluto was safe, because I still had some affection for him. One night, when I was drunk, Pluto tried to avoid me. I grabbed him, and he bit my hand. Full of anger, I cut out one of his eyes. In the morning I felt guilty, but soon I forgot everything in more alcohol.</li><li>Pluto recovered, but now he was afraid of me and ran away when I came close. At first I felt sad, but soon I became angry. One day, because of a strange feeling of perverseness, I put a rope around his neck and hung him from a tree. I cried, but I still killed him. That same night, a fire started in my house. My wife and I escaped, but everything was destroyed. The next day, I went to see the ruins. On the only wall still standing, there was an image of a giant cat with a rope around its neck. At first I was terrified, but then I told myself that someone had thrown the cat into my room during the fire, and the body made this strange mark on the wall. Even so, for months I could not forget the horrible picture of the cat on the wall.</li><li>One night, in a bar, I saw another black cat. It looked almost the same as Pluto, except for a white spot on its chest. The cat followed me home, and my wife loved it. At first I liked the cat, but later I began to hate it. It always followed me, jumped on my knees, and rubbed against me. I wanted to hurt it, but I remembered Pluto and felt afraid. Later, I noticed the white spot on its chest began to look like a gallows, the place where people are hanged. This filled me with terror. The cat never left me alone. At night I had nightmares, and during the day it stayed close to me. I started to hate everything and everyone. My wife suffered because of my violent temper, but she stayed silent and patient.</li><li>One day, I went to the cellar with my wife, and the cat followed us. It almost made me fall on the stairs, and I became furious. I took an axe to kill it, but my wife stopped me.  I turned and killed her with the axe. She fell dead immediately. I decided to hide the body. Finally, I put her inside the wall of the cellar and covered it carefully with bricks. Nobody could see anything strange. The cat disappeared, and I was happy. Four days later, the police came to search the house. I was calm because I thought everything was perfect. When they were ready to leave, I hit the wall proudly with my cane. Suddenly, a terrible cry came from inside. The police broke the wall and found my wife’s body. On her head was the black cat, alive, with its red mouth and burning eye. I had walled it up with the corpse.</li></ul><div style="display:none"><p class="exe-sortableList-buttonText">Try</p><p class="exe-sortableList-rightText">Correct!</p><div class="exe-sortableList-ideviceID js-hidden">20251026111615-60</div><div class="exe-sortableList-evaluationID js-hidden"></div><div class="exe-sortableList-evaluationMessages js-hidden">Actividad no completada#Actividad superada.
